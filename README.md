Name of the project : Medical Insurance Cost Detection | Language used : Python

The "Medical Insurance Cost Detection" project uses machine learning to predict medical insurance costs
based on demographic and health-related information based on factors like age, gender, BMI, number of
children, smoking habits, and region. The steps involved include data collection, cleaning, exploratory data
analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy,
matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn are used. The data is cleaned, analyzed for patterns, and features are
engineered. Different models like linear regression, decision tree, and random forest are evaluated, and the
best-performing model is chosen. The project aims to assist healthcare providers and insurance companies in
predicting insurance costs for customers to aid decision-making and cost management.
