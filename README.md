Project: Medical Insurance Cost Detection
Role: Data Scientist
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
Modeling Techniques: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest

Description:
Led the development of a cutting-edge Medical Insurance Cost Detection system utilizing machine learning techniques to predict insurance costs based on demographic and health-related factors. The project aimed to empower healthcare providers and insurance companies with accurate predictions to enhance decision-making and cost management.

Project Workflow:

Data Collection: Gathered a diverse dataset incorporating demographic and health-related information, including age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region, from various sources.
Data Cleaning: Conducted thorough data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset's quality and reliability.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilized pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform EDA, gaining insights into data distributions, correlations, and identifying patterns.
Feature Engineering: Engineered relevant features to enhance the predictive power of the models, incorporating domain knowledge and insights from the EDA.
Model Selection: Implemented different machine learning models, including linear regression, decision tree, and random forest, leveraging scikit-learn. Evaluated models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Evaluation: Rigorously evaluated model performance using cross-validation and appropriate evaluation metrics, ensuring robustness and reliability.
Best-Performing Model Selection: Identified and selected the best-performing model, considering both accuracy and interpretability.
Technologies Used:

Outcome:
The Medical Insurance Cost Detection project successfully developed a predictive model capable of estimating insurance costs based on key demographic and health-related factors. This project not only demonstrated proficiency in machine learning and data analysis but also showcased the potential to assist healthcare providers and insurance companies in making informed decisions regarding insurance costs and resource allocation.
